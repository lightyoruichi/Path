Overpath: A wordpress theme with pjax
=====================================

This theme is built on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) by Paul Irish and Divya Manian. 

It's HTML 5 ready, and all the navigation between pages(currently only support index.php & single.php) uses [jquery-pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax), transitions between pages are all CSS 3 animation.

Its design is based on the idea of Path, especially its web version. The comcept of timeline is extracted and used as the main leading part of all. So browsing between pages is just slipping on the timeline.

Demo
----
My blog [Xiao Life Journal](http://xiaolife.com) is using this theme. As a testing ground for me, it can be broken at any time.

Current State
-------------
Not tested on IE 6-8. Partly work on IE 9. Should be compitable with IE 10.

Incompitable with Opera since Opera doesn't support css animation well.

Not ready for production use yet.

Some bugs when doing with pjax.

Javascript code is a mess, so NEED SOMEONE TO REWRITE IT.

Next Plan
---------
1. Fix pjax bugs
2. Build up other pages like page.php and 404.php

Used jQuery Plugins
-------------------
1. jquery.transition.js
2. jquery.pjax.js
3. jquery.smoothscroll.js
4. jquery.autoresize.js


Root Images
-----------

### background.jpg
Use your own. Will add a setting for this.

### background_sidebar.jpg
The background texture for slide sidebar.

### favicon.ico
The favicon is the icon shown to the left of the URL at the top of your browser window.

### apple-touch-icon.png
On iPhones and iPads you can book mark a web page and have it show up on the home screen as an icon. The apple-touch-icon.png becomes this icon if used. Rounded corners and glossy finish are added by the device.

Title Font
----------
The Logo is designed to use Conquette bold font. To use it, you need to buy a web license for the font.
